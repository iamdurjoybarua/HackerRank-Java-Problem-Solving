## About HackerRank

[HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) is a technology company that focuses on competitive programming challenges for both individuals and businesses. It provides a platform for coders to practice and improve their coding skills by solving algorithmic problems, often used by companies for technical interviews.

---

## Repository Structure

The solutions are organized by the HackerRank domain or topic. Each problem typically resides in its own file, named according to the problem's title or a short identifier.

---

## Java Version

Most solutions are written with a focus on compatibility and often use common Java features available in **Java 8 and above**, as this is the standard on HackerRank.

While solutions are generally modern Java, some older problems or specific constraints might lead to solutions optimized for or compatible with Java 6/4. Please check the individual file headers for specific version notes if applicable.

## How to Use

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/HackerRank-Java.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/HackerRank-Java.git)
    cd HackerRank-Java
    ```
2.  **Navigate to a problem:**
    Each problem's solution is a standalone Java file. For example, to view the `SolveMeFirst` solution:
    ```bash
    # (assuming you are in the root of the cloned repository)
    cat src/algorithms/warm_up/SolveMeFirst.java
    ```
3.  **Run a solution (locally):**
    You can compile and run most solutions directly from your terminal. Be aware that HackerRank often uses custom input/output mechanisms. You might need to provide input via `System.in` or modify the `main` method for local testing.

    Example for `SolveMeFirst.java`:
    ```bash
    javac src/algorithms/warm_up/SolveMeFirst.java
    java -cp src/algorithms/warm_up SolveMeFirst
    # Then provide input, e.g., 2 followed by 3 and press Enter
    ```
