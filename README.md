# My Java HackerRank Journey: Solving 64 Problems

---

## Overview

This repository holds my comprehensive assignment on solving 64 distinct Java programming problems on HackerRank. It's a detailed record of my efforts to sharpen my problem-solving skills, deepen my understanding of algorithms, and demonstrate my proficiency in Java.

The heart of this repository is the main assignment document, which covers my approach, the challenges I faced, and the key insights I gained throughout this intensive coding practice.

## About the Assignment

My main goal for this assignment was to solidify fundamental Java concepts and develop advanced problem-solving strategies applicable to both competitive programming and professional software development. The 64 problems I tackled covered a wide range of topics from HackerRank's Java domain, including:

* **Java Fundamentals**: Basic syntax, input/output operations, control flow, and data types.
* **String Manipulation & Regular Expressions**: Efficient handling of strings and pattern matching.
* **BigNumber**: Practical use of `BigInteger` and `BigDecimal` for arbitrary-precision arithmetic.
* **Core Data Structures**: Hands-on application of Arrays, ArrayLists, HashSets, HashMaps, Stacks, Queues, and PriorityQueues.
* **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Reinforcing principles like Inheritance, Interfaces, Abstract Classes, and Method Overriding.
* **Exception Handling**: Building robust code with effective `try-catch` blocks.
* **Advanced Java Concepts**: Exploring Reflection, Design Patterns (Factory, Singleton), Annotations, and Lambda Expressions.

Through this project, I aimed not just to find solutions, but to truly grasp the underlying principles, analyze complexity, and write clean, efficient Java code.
